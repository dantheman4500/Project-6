## Introduction: 
The gaming community has grown exponentially this past decade. Games are released almost daily - ranging from small companies to franchises with histories spanning decades long. Alongside this expansion and the physical disconnect brought by the pandemic, it has become apparent that users/gamers alike need to find ways to continue connecting with one another. Let Game Rewiew help you! Online engagement is essential. Game Rewiew allows users to write, share, and read eachother's reviews on some of your most loved titles. 

## Project Description

Game Rewiew is a node based application that relies on databases to generate information on user-selected video game titles. User's are then able to keep their favorited games and write their own reviews. Keeping them on one profile page allows the user the ability to organize and keep track of their favorite titles.

## User Story

- AS A video game enthusiast looking to share collective experiences
- I WANT a clean, easy-to-use application that can render my favorite titles and allow me to write personal reviews
- SO THAT I can share my experiences with the gaming community at large.  

## Acceptance Criteria: 

- USE Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API
- USE Handlebars.js as the template engine.
- USE MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
- HAVE both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
- USE at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.
- HAVE a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
- INCLUDE authentication (express-session and cookies).
- PROTECT API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
- BE deployed using [Heroku (with data)](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/deploy-with-heroku-and-mysql).
- HAVE a polished UI.
- BE responsive.
- BE interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- MEET good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
