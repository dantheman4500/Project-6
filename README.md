## Introduction: 
The gaming community has grown so much throughout the past decade! Modern day technology has made it possible for people to create their own smaller games alongside larger popular franchises such as League of Legends, World of Warcraft, and Call of Duty. Thus, the choices as a user are endless! With the expansion of modern technology, gamers worldwide are able to share their love for games with in-depth reviews. Let Game Rewiew help you! Write, share, and read other users reviews on some of your most loved titles.  

## Project Description

Game Rewiew is a node based application that relies on a database to generate information on user-selected video game titles. User's are then able to keep their favorited games and write their own reviews. Keeping them on one profile page allows the user the ability to organize and keep track of some of their favorite titles.

## User Story

- I WANT a clean, easy-to-use application that can render my favorite titles and allow me to write personal reviews
- SO THAT I can share my experiences with the gaming community at large.
